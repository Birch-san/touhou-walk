The copyright of Touhou Project (東方プロジェクト) — including its characters, content, quotes, and music — belongs to 上海アリス幻樂団 (Team Shanghai Alice), which is ZUN (http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/)'s circle. This is a derivative work.

This Android app creates an overlay, to make sprites from 東方Project walk around your screen.

It is my attempt to rebuild [FREE WING](http://www.neko.ne.jp/~freewing/android/)'s [_Touhou Character Walk1_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.ne.neko.freewing.TouhouProject) to render well on high-density displays. The original app produces extremely tiny sprites on modern phones; this project aims to make the sprites reasonably-sized (or configurably-sized).

The sprite images used belong to Mr. Rev of [レヴの館](http://revdot.web.fc2.com).
